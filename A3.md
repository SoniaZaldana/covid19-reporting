# A3 

## Post Mortem 

1. What goals have been achieved.

For the past deliverable, we accomplished the following: 

* The client wanted a user interface which included a Covid-19 reporting form based on the form he provided us. He didn't have any specific requests regarding styling, instead he wanted us to make sure it included all the elements the original form had. We accomplished this goal by creating a react form, which is separated in sections just like the one the client provided us. This allowed us to verify we included all elements. 
* The client wanted us to POST the filled out Covid-19 form to the FHIR server using the `/DocumentReference` endpoint. We accomplished half of this goal by creating a JSON format which would present the form input in a cohesive manner. This is what we set out to do for this deliverable, knowing it would take some time to go over the form and design an equivalent JSON. As part of our development plan, we knew that we would do the work regarding sending this JSON to the FHIR server as part of the final deliverable. 
* The client wanted us to ensure the information being sent over to the FHIR server was sensible. As a result, we set out as one of our goals for this milestone to implement basic form validation such as ensuring countries or names don't include numbers or symbols. We also achieved this goal for this deliverable.

2. What goals have been missed, and by how much.
* Though we initially implemented form validation for A2, we didn't add any unit tests to validate the code. As a result, we  also realized we probably need to refactor some of the validation code to test it properly. We hope to bridge this testing gap and refactor our code for A3. 
* Additionally, we set out to do more testing regarding the construction of the JSON to be sent to the FHIR server. However, based on conversations with our client and our TA, we agreed that it did not make sense to write tests to verify the JSON. The reason for this is that the only sensible test we could write is one that ensures the JSON contains all the fields that existed in the original form provided by the client. However, since we are not generating this JSON dynamically based on an array of forms, and we are only working with 1 static form, it doesn't make sense to write tests of this nature. Instead, what we need are more tests regarding the interaction of this JSON with the FHIR server, which will be included for the deliverable for A3. 

3. How plans were adjusted, in light of that information, including goals or features that were dropped 
* We have adjusted our plans to account for the need to refactor our form validation, so that we can include sensible test coverage for this feature. 
* Additionally, we decided to engage in conversations with the client in how to better validate that our web app is correctly interacting with the FHIR server. Though this is discussed in more depth below, the main idea is that we need tests to ensure we get the correct response codes when interacting with the FHIR server. 
* No features were dropped in light of the goals we missed. 

## Overview of Project 

Our project is a web app consisting of a covid-19 reporting form which is then sent to the HAPI FHIR server. Find below a list of our features along with a description of how they work and the acceptance criteria discussed with the client: 

1. A full fledged user interface that allows users to input their responses to the Covid-19 reporting form, which is based on the form provided by the client found [here](https://github.com/IHE-SDC-WG/SDC-Sample-XML-Files/blob/master/COVID%2019/2019-covid-crf-v6.pdf). 

### How Does The Feature Work 
We have created a react app with a cohesive form for Covid-19 reporting which is scalable to all devices: desktop and mobile. 

### Acceptance Criteria & How We Met It 
Based on discussions with our client, they didn’t have any specific considerations with regards to the styling of this form. Instead, they specified the acceptance criteria for this feature would consist of verifying that each of the elements in the form provided to us is also included in the user interface of our web application. We have met this verification criteria with careful reviews of our form against the one we were provided by all of our team members and the client. 

2. Our web application supports form validation for the users’ responses and it provides feedback when input is invalid. 

### How Does The Feature Work 
Our form ensures each field only receives sensible data. This means verifying that names or countries don’t include symbols, dates are specified in a specific format, ages are strictly numbers, etc. 

### Acceptance Criteria & How We Met It 
Based on discussions with our client, the acceptance criteria for this feature is a series of unit tests to ensure each of the fields in the form receives sensible data. We have met this verification criteria by providing these form validation unit tests. 

3. Our web application supports the ability to POST the responses to the form as an attachment to the `/DocumentReference` endpoint in the HAPI FHIR server. 

### How Does The Feature Work 
The [/DocumentReference](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documentreference.html#resource) endpoint provides metadata about any document stored in the FHIR server allowing it to be discovered and managed by a healthcare system. The purpose of this feature is allowing Covid-19 reporting forms to be easily managed by various healthcare agents. 

### Acceptance Criteria & How We Met It 
The acceptance criteria for this feature, as specified by the client, consists of tests verifying we get the expected response code when posting our document. This includes verifying a successful message with a valid attachment versus an error message with an invalid attachment. We have fulfilled this verification criteria by providing unit tests for both these scenarios in our code base. Note that we opted out of using a GET request to validate we had posted our attachment to the server, as we are mocking the POST requests so that we are not actually posting to the HAPI FHIR server every time we run our tests. 

## Project Rationale and Extensibility 
Early in our discussions with the client, we chose to use the `/DocumentReference` endpoint for the FHIR server, as opposed to using a `/QuestionnaireResponse` endpoint. The reason behind this is because mapping the data elements in the form does not provide a 1:1 match. We made this decision following advice from the client, based on their own experience trying to work with the `/QuestionnaireResponse` endpoint. 

In light of this, we think our project can be extended by adding support to POST the Covid-19 reporting form to the `/QuestionnaireResponse` endpoint. However, this would also include fine tuning the form itself, which was outside of the scope of what the client requested. 

Aside from adding support for that endpoint, which the client didn't require, we completed all the tasks that we set out to complete at the beginning of our development process.
