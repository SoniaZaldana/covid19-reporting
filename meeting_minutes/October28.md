# Meeting 2021/10/28:
Attendees: Sonia, Samarth

## Agenda:
- Discuss Alex’s messages 
- Create a JSON mapping for the provided XML form https://github.com/IHE-SDC-WG/SDC-Sample-XML-Files/blob/master/COVID%2019/COVID-19.393_1.000.000.CTP1_sdcFDF.xml

## Minutes:
- Alex said that we have the freedom to format the JSON in whatever way we see fit and send that as an attachment for the Document Reference endpoint. 
- With that in mind, we have to come up with a format we think is reasonable to attach the form’s questions and answers. 
- We agreed on a format for the JSON response and created a JSON_mapping.md doc to document all the decisions we made. 
- Samarth is completing sections 0, 1 and 2. Sonia is completing sections 3 and 4. 
- Samarth agreed to work on this today first, so we don’t run into conflicts. 
- The validation of the data to be put into the JSON will be done by Sebastian, so we don’t worry about that for our work.
