## Message sent to Client 
Hi Alex, 
As we are approaching our final deliverable, we wanted to touch base with you one last time to ensure we are meeting the expectations for our project. We have drafted this acceptance criteria for our project and were wondering if you could provide us feedback. 

Find below a list of the features and the acceptance criteria: 
A full fledged user interface that allows users to input their responses to the Covid-19 reporting form, as specified by the XML you provided us at the beginning of the semester. The acceptance criteria consists of verifying each of the elements in the XML form are included in the UI. 
Form validation for the responses to the form. The acceptance criteria consists of various unit tests to ensure each field receives sensible data i.e. names shouldnâ€™t include numbers or symbols, dates should follow a specific format, etc. 
The ability to POST the responses to the form as an attachment to the /DocumentReference endpoint in the HAPI FHIR server. The acceptance criteria consists of tests verifying we get the expected response code when POSTing as well as GET tests to verify our document was correctly sent to the server. 

## Client Response
He said excellent job, no feedback at the moment.
