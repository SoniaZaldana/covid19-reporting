# Assignment 1: Parajuniper Project 4 Covid-19 Reporting
Project 4 specifies we convert an XML-based COVID-19 CDC reporting form to JSON, render it into a UI for users to fill out and submit it as a FHIR message to an existing FHIR server. Upon discussing with the client, we have settled on the tech stack discussed below. 

## Tech Stack and Toolchain 

### React App 
Our client wanted us to build a web application that was presented nicely without any specifications or constraints as to how that should look. We have decided to build a React app, as it allows us to build a singe-page application with reusable components if our client chooses to extend our application in the future. We chose this framework as the majority of our team is already familiar with React, and we could benefit from deepening this knowledge. Additionally, we are creating our React app with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), because it allows us to use only one dependency to install many other dependencies that wouldn't automatically be installed if we were creating a React application any other way. Finally, we decided against using frameworks such as Vue or Angular, as none of us had any exposure working with those before. 

### React Bootstrap 
We are using react-bootstrap as our front-end stylesheet library, which serves as reimplementation of bootstrap components as react components, as it provides an out-of-the-box responsive grid system which would allow us to make our app mobile-friendly. Additionally, it provides cross-browser compatibility and it is extremely time-saving as we don't have to build components from scratch. We are using react bootstrap, per recommendation of the UX experts in our team, to deliver a practical and meaningful application.

### Axios
Since our application needs to submit a FHIR message to existing REST APIs in the FHIR server, we need to use an HTTP client. We chose axios as our HTTP client as we had members in our team that were already familiar with this library and could leverage that for the success of our team. 

### Docker
We decided to use Docker as our container to easily pack and run our application because we had a few members in our team that had some basic experience working with it. Docker is also extremely popular and we hoped working with it offered an opportunity for all of us to learn this skill. We rejected using other containers such as Vagrant as none of us had any experience with other containers and we wouldn’t be able to help each other out through the process of learning. 

## Project Development Plan
We are working under 3 milestones and an unofficial milestone 0 that we need to accomplish to finish assignment 1. 
### Milestone 0 
By the end of this milestone, we hope to have accomplished the following: 
- Set up a container with a toy app that outputs “I am running!” and exits in one test. 
- Set up an identical toy application that prints “I am running a test!” and exits. 
- Set up a GitHub repository with clear development practices for everyone i.e. code reviews, branches, PR etiquette. 
- Establish communication practices for the rest of the semester
- Samarth will aid creating a container. Sonia will aid reformatting our discussion and A1 and uploading meeting minutes. Matias and Sebastian will aid with code reviews. 

### Milestone 1
By this milestone, we hope to have accomplished the following: 
- We are able to convert the provided XML form to JSON 
- We have tests validating that we have successfully converted it from XML to JSON
- We have at least some type of landing screen for our web application

### Milestone 2
By this milestone, we hope to have accomplished the following: 
- Have rendered a cohesive UI to present the form
- Have implemented form validation that adheres with what FHIR messages can include 
- Have implemented tests to check form validation 
- Matias will aid by leveraging his experience in UX to ensure we have the best display possible. 
- Samarth and Sebastian will aid implementing logic for form validation and testing. 
- Sonia will aid by ensuring FHIR compliance and developing React components where necessary. 

### Milestone 3
By this milestone, we hope to have accomplished the following: 
- Use the HTTP client to implement POST calls for the test HAPI server.
- Implemented tests that validate that the form was successfully posted adhering to FHIR standards. 
- Made any adjustments to our web application based on mid-cycle check in feedback. 
- Sonia will aid writing axios client calls to POST to the test server. 
- Matias will aid writing tests for calls to the server. 
- Samarth and Sebastian will aid addressing any feedback from the mid-cycle check in and code review. 


### Immediate actions to achieve the first of our milestones: 
- Samarth to create a container with a toy application that outputs “I am running!” 
- Everyone in the team should research and code review Samarth’s work on the container so we are all familiar with how Docker works. 
- Sonia and Matias to start dissecting the XML COVID-19 form to analyze how to convert it to JSON. 
- Sebastian and Samarth to verify compliance with FHIR and  write tests for Sonia and Matias’ work on the conversion. 
- Sebastian to start becoming familiar with React and create a simple landing page.
