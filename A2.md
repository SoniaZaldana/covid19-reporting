# Assignment 2: Parajuniper Project 4 Covid-19 Reporting

## A description of the features we planned to implement for A2 

### Converting the provided XML form to JSON and create a message that adheres to FHIR standards

#### Subtasks (Samarth & Sonia to complete by November 2nd): 
a. Talk to Alex to get more information about the JSON format. 
b. Agree on a format for our JSON together.
c. Convert XML form to JSON divided up in sections individually.
d. Ensuring our JSON attachment complies with what the `/DocumentReference` endpoint accepts in the FHIR server as an attachment. 

#### Acceptance Criteria: 
From the discussion with the client, they specified they do not have any particular concerns about the format of the JSON attachment in the endpoint. As long as it was consistent and it offered insight into the questions and answers, it should be sufficient. 

As a result, our acceptance criteria is to have created a JSON FHIR attachment that adheres to what the `/DocumentReference` endpoint accepts. 

#### Status 
COMPLETED

### Creating a cohesive UI to render the form 

#### Subtasks (Matias to complete by November 1st): 
a. Create a landing page 
b. Create the form based off the PDF form we have been provided with. 

#### Acceptance Criteria: 
From the discussion with the client, they are not too concerned about the form looking a specific way. They adviced that any form that is readable and presents the information cohesively is acceptable. 

As a result, our acceptance criteria is to have created a landing page which adheres to best UX practices and scales well in both mobile and desktop devices. 

#### Status
COMPLETED

### Testing and validating the form 

#### Subtasks (Sebastian to complete by November 4th): 
a. Validating form results to ensure they comply with FHIR standards. 

#### Acceptance Criteria:
From the discussion with the client, they don't have particular constraints for the JSON. Therefore, we have set as the acceptance criteria to have sufficient form validation so that it rejects any information which would not fit under the JSON format we have designed. 

### Status 
PENDING

### Feature Prioritization Rationale 

We have decided on implementing the following features for the A2 deliverable, as they provide the bare bones functionality to our application. After completing this milestone, we will be in an excellent position to showcase our industry partner the foundation of our solution, so we can either adjust if something hasn't been done well or carry on with our development plan.
