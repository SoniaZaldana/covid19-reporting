## A description of the features we planned to implement for A2 

### Converting the provided XML form to JSON and create a message that adheres to FHIR standards

#### Subtasks (Samarth & Sonia to complete by November 2nd):

c. Base64 encode the JSON form 
d. Create the FHIR message

b. Create the form based off the PDF form we have been provided with. 

#### Acceptance Criteria: 
To have created a landing page which adheres to best UX practices and scales well in both mobile and desktop devices. Client has no preference to how it should look. 

### Testing and validating the form 

#### Subtasks (Sebastian to complete by November 4th): 
a. Validating form results to ensure they comply with FHIR standards. 

#### Acceptance Criteria:

### Feature Prioritization Rationale 

We have decided on implementing the following features for the A2 deliverable, as they provide the bare bones functionality to our application. After completing this milestone, we will be in an excellent position to showcase our industry partner the foundation of our solution, so we can either adjust if something hasn't been done well or carry on with our development plan.
